#CRUD App

Class exercise. CRUD app with 3 relational models on RoR, PG database, RESTful Routing, Resources, and deployed on Heroku. 

No time to add styling and many of the links for the additional models were not added due to time constraints but they were successfully tested and hit by adding the appropriate pathing to the URL (found by raking the routes and commented in the routes.rb).
